Golf Performance
Group Project by Marc Edwards, Yedin Lui, Xinzhe Qi

The Varsity Golf Team began collecting their round data during the Fall of 2019. 
However, they only had it stored in a spreadsheet and gave thjem no real insights to their game.
Our group took this data and tranformed it into an interactive UI using RShiny. 
There was a lot of data manipulation, mutation, and cleansing that went into this project. 
Our video presentation and poster can be found within the repository.
